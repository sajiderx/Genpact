Thanks all, great convo.  Some important parts that will inform our solution (correct me here, this is for alignment)...

The case reports come in standard-ish formats delivered via email that attaches to a sharepoint folder separated by client.  Some of these are literally faxed copies of paper reports, and they even have examples of handwritten case reports.  So the core problem is finding the appropriate data on the form with high reliability and properly flagging when it needs human review.

So I think our databricks ingestion framework can absolutely handle the data ingestion (land the attachment, extract metadata, etc.) but the processing of those files is fundamentally an information extraction use case (e.g. "read this PDF").  We should assume high variability in field position, labeling and even data quality. 

The ultimate need / ask / interest from the client is both to automate the high volume case reports for known forms and to allow for the system to handle new types of forms as they come in.  The direct ask is to make ingesting these new forms end-user configurable, although I'm not sure if that's how we'll implement it...this to me is the biggest unknown risk to the implementation.

To directly address the question Sajid asked, I think enhancing something that's architectural sound and kindof works is a good idea ... but taking over other people's code is always tricky, so we should assess the work of taking over their stuff in practice vs. recoding their stuff and adding our stuff (my rule of thumb is if we have to touch 20% of the code a rewrite is usually easier).

Hope this is helpful, happy to huddle if needed.

Steve

Hi Dip,
Thanks for weighing in... really helpful perspective. You’re absolutely right that the standard ingestion/curation/publishing approach fits well here. I hadn’t thought about framing it through that lens but it makes a lot of sense.

A couple of things I want to make sure we’re aligned on before next week:

The format variability piece is a bit tricky. These are technically structured forms (same fields across all sponsors), but the physical layout is all over the place. Like, “Patient Name” might be in the top left on Pfizer’s form and bottom right on Merck’s form so our profiling and DQ approach will need to be smart about finding fields by context, not just position. Definitely doable, just want to make sure we’re designing for that reality.

On the pipeline side, I think we’re seeing the same picture:
 • They’ve got Databricks handling extraction, but we need to add the normalization and validation layer on top
 • Output needs to be standardized for regulatory submissions with full audit trail.

One thing I’d love your take on - should we position this as enhancing what they already have with our framework wrapped around it or are we thinking bigger replacement? 

My gut says enhance and optimize since they’ve already invested in the Databricks piece but curious what you think.

Thanks again for the input!

As long as the different formats are structured, our ingestion framework, with profiling and DQ capabilities, will work. Additionally, it sounds like they need the standard data pipeline approach - ingestion, curation, and publishing data products.

Happy to discuss the details next week. Thanks.

Dip can our ingestion framework help with some of this?

Hi Steve,
I wanted to give you a quick update on the code walkthrough call with Yash from Thermo Fisher this afternoon.

Yash walked us through their current document processing system. They’ve built a working prototype that uses Azure Blob Storage as the document repository, with Databricks handling the ML-based extraction through an MLOps pipeline. The system is processing actual AE/SAE pharmacovigilance forms (MedWatch, CIOMS formats). This is AS IS Flow and ready to be deployed.

Challenge - They’re dealing with multi-sponsor submissions meaning the same form type i.e. MedWatch 3500 etc comes in dozens of different formats from different pharma companies. This format variability is the core accuracy challenge… what we build needs to handle this chaos, not just clean templates.

Our Approach - I’m recommending a hybrid strategy that enhances their existing Databricks investment rather than replacing it. We’ll add Azure Form Recognizer for structured field extraction where appropriate, build the missing normalization/validation layers, and create the UI for manual review. This respects their work while optimizing the overall solution.

Documentation Exchange - Yash will be sharing their architectural diagrams and technical documentation with us. I plan to send him our proposed approach first before reviewing their docs in detail. I want to make sure our recommendations come from an independent assessment rather than being overly influenced by their existing design choices. Once I receive their documentation, I’ll refine and adjust our approach accordingly to align with their architecture, address their specific concerns and incorporate their recommendations. The goal is to bring fresh perspective while being thoughtful about what they’ve already built.

Access Update - Yash confirmed that tickets for our Thermo Fisher email accounts and MFA were submitted but our names aren’t showing up when he searches in Outlook yet. He said he’ll look into it. However, I got the sense that urgency is relatively low on their side… he mentioned we have “a few months” to get this done.
I appreciate having adequate time based on Yash’s comments that we will be working on this project for several months to come, I’d prefer to design well and execute with a pass/fail fast mentality. We should set the pace and show rapid progress rather than drift into a slow-moving consulting engagement. Yash appreciated this thought. 

Next Steps:
1.	Attend Sprint Planning Meeting Monday Morning at 9 AM EST.
2.	Send our proposed approach to Yash early next week.
3.	Review their architectural documentation once received and refine our proposal.
4.	Prepare a comprehensive presentation for the Oct 29 SOW meeting.
5.	Follow up with Yash on the access issue.

Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss the approach.

Warm Regards
Sajid
