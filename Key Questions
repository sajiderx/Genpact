KEY QUESTIONS FOR TOMORROW'S CALL

SharePoint Integration:
- How many SharePoint folders are we monitoring?
- What's the volume of documents - daily/weekly/monthly?
- Are there any access/permission issues with SharePoint integration?
- Do different folders represent different document types or sources?

Current Process Pain Points:
- What's the current turnaround time from document arrival to data entry?
- How much time does the manual download/upload process take?
- What percentage of documents require manual correction after processing?
- What are the most common extraction errors you're seeing?

Document Characteristics:
- What types of AE/SAE forms are you processing? (FDA 3500, CIOMS, custom forms?)
- What percentage are handwritten vs. typed?
- Are these mostly scanned PDFs or digital documents?
- What's the typical page count per document?

Data Requirements:
- What downstream systems consume this data?
- Are there specific regulatory requirements we need to meet (FDA, EMA)?
- What's the required data quality threshold for auto-approval?
- What fields are absolutely critical vs. nice-to-have?

Current Prototype:
- What's working well in the current prototype?
- What are the biggest limitations or frustrations?
- Is there any logic or rules we should preserve?
- What would success look like for the enhanced version?


TALKING POINTS
When They Show You Their Current Solution:
✅ I see you're manually bridging SharePoint to the processing system. We can automate that entire flow using SharePoint webhooks or scheduled polling. That alone would save significant manual effort.
✅ For AE/SAE documents specifically, we'll need custom-trained Form Recognizer models. The pre-built models won't handle the regulatory forms well. Have you started training custom models yet?
✅ One thing I'd recommend is separating the extraction logic (Model A) from the normalization logic (Model B). That gives us flexibility to enhance each independently and makes testing much easier.
✅ For the narrative text fields in AE reports, we'll want to add NLP analysis. That'll help with severity assessment and medical coding.
✅"We should implement a confidence-based routing system - high confidence goes straight through, medium confidence gets validated, low confidence gets manual review. That'll maximize automation while maintaining quality.
