Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Report

Case Intake Application – AI Extraction Stress Test
Prepared by: Sajid Inayat
Primary Owner: Helios Peti
Date: November 6, 2025

1. Executive Summary

This RCA analyzes failures encountered during the stress testing of the Case Intake Application’s AI extraction module.
Three core issues were identified: (1) large image handling, (2) multi-page document timeouts, and (3) bulk upload delays.
Immediate corrective actions are underway, led by Helios Peti under Sajid Inayat’s supervision, to validate fixes and stabilize the AI processing pipeline before the next test cycle.

2. Problem Description

Stress tests involved simultaneous uploads of large image-heavy PDFs and 100-page multi-document batches through the Case Intake Application. Failures included extraction stalls, incomplete outputs, and performance degradation under concurrent load.

3. Root Cause Analysis
Issue	Root Cause	Evidence / Logs	Severity
Large Image Failures	OCR engine exceeded pixel limit on high-DPI images (300–600 DPI) within 32 MB PDFs	“IMAGE_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED” errors in logs	High
Multi-Page Timeout	Memory exhaustion from concurrent long-running OCR jobs on 100-page PDFs	Pending jobs > 2 hours	High
Bulk Upload Latency	Worker pool saturation; limited concurrency causing serialized queueing	94 files ≈ 1 min each	Medium
4. Corrective & Preventive Actions (CAPA)
#	Action	Owner	Target Date	Expected Outcome
1	Downsample and reprocess 32 MB file (~150 DPI)	Helios Peti	Nov 8	Validate image-size stability
2	Implement pre-validation & compression for oversized images	Helios / Engineering Team	Nov 9	Prevent OCR overload before processing
3	Memory profiling for large PDF batches	Helios Peti	Nov 9	Identify optimal memory allocation
4	Concurrency tuning & re-test in staged batches (30/60/90 files)	Helios Peti	Nov 11	Improve throughput and reduce queue delay
5. Findings Summary & Recommendations

Image resolution, not file size, is the main driver of failures.

Processing performance degrades linearly with page count under concurrent load.

Implementing image pre-checks and workload batching should improve stability by > 60%.

Introduce auto-scaling or event-driven job dispatch for future testing.
