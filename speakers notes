Hi, I’m Sajid. I currently lead Data and AI initiatives at EvolutionRx, where we’ve been building a platform called ParseRx that helps automate clinical trial data processing. Basically, our clients like Abbott, J&J, and Medtronic used to spend weeks manually converting consent forms and adverse event reports into FDA formats like SDTM and ADaM — now ParseRx does that in hours using a mix of AI, OCR, and NLP, with a human-in-the-loop review for compliance.

Before that, I’ve led several data modernization projects, moving on-prem systems like Informix and Oracle into AWS Redshift and Snowflake using Glue, Lambda, and Step Functions. I also built an IoT-based BioBanking pipeline that monitors temperature and humidity in medical freezers using Kinesis and Databricks, and even integrated anomaly detection models to alert principal investigators in real time.

Across all my projects, my focus has been connecting large-scale data engineering with AI and governance — making sure that innovation doesn’t come at the cost of compliance. I’m hands-on with AWS, Databricks, and Snowflake, and I love designing solutions that are not just technically sound, but also auditable, scalable, and meaningful to the business.
