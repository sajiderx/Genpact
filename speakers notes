Got it 👍 — since you’re still waiting for environment and data access from the Thermo Fisher team, this is the perfect time to define a structured “pre-access” milestone plan so that your leadership (Dip / Xponential) and the client both see steady progress.

Below is a concise, actionable roadmap you can share in your next email or status update — covering next steps, milestones, and ownership while you wait for access.

🧭 AI-Powered AE/SAE Modernization – Next Steps & Milestones

Current Status
	•	✅ Proposal submitted and architecture defined (Azure-based AI pipeline).
	•	⚙️ Awaiting Thermo Fisher’s sandbox / dataset access to initiate Model A (Azure Document Intelligence) setup.
	•	📅 Target start: once credentials, sample PDFs, and schema definitions are shared.

⸻

📍Phase 0 – Pre-Access Preparation (Week 0–2)

Goal: Build internal readiness and complete mock validation using synthetic AE/SAE data.

Task	Description	Owner
0.1	Define target schema fields (AE_ID, EventTerm, Seriousness, Outcome, Drug, Reporter)	Sajid / Data Eng
0.2	Mock AE/SAE document set (10–20 samples) for pipeline dry run	Xponential team
0.3	Build Azure resource scaffolding (Functions, Blob, OpenAI, Cosmos DB)	Azure Admin / DE
0.4	Create Schema Service baseline + /validate API	Sajid
0.5	Draft prompt templates for Model B	Sajid / Dip review

📈 Deliverable: “Internal Dry Run” results report using synthetic AE/SAE cases.

⸻

📍Phase 1 – Access & Environment Setup (Week 2–3)

Goal: Establish secure connection and test AI pipeline with Thermo Fisher data.

Task	Description	Owner
1.1	Receive access credentials to Azure subscription / shared resource group	Thermo Fisher IT
1.2	Upload 10 real AE/SAE case reports to Blob for baseline run	Client data team
1.3	Validate environment (connectivity, permissions, Key Vault, API keys)	Sajid / Cloud Eng
1.4	Conduct end-to-end test of Model A (Azure Document Intelligence extraction)	DE team
1.5	Review extraction results & confidence thresholds	Sajid / Dip / Client QA

📈 Deliverable: Verified extraction JSON + confidence dashboard for AE/SAE fields.

⸻

📍Phase 2 – Model Integration & Validation (Week 4–6)

Goal: Integrate Model B (OpenAI normalization) and Schema Service validation.

Task	Description	Owner
2.1	Plug normalized Model B output into Schema Service /validate	DE team
2.2	Perform schema validation and MedDRA term normalization	AI/DE team
2.3	Route low-confidence cases to human-in-the-loop UI	Sajid / Frontend Dev
2.4	Review accuracy metrics vs. manual baseline	Client QA
2.5	Sign-off on Phase 2 results	Thermo Fisher PM

📈 Deliverable: 90%+ accuracy achieved on AE/SAE schema validation.

⸻

📍Phase 3 – Pilot & Reporting (Week 7–8)

Goal: Deliver working proof of concept and success metrics.

Task	Description	Owner
3.1	Process full pilot batch (50–100 AE/SAE reports)	DE team
3.2	Generate performance report (time, cost, accuracy, compliance)	Sajid / Dip
3.3	Present outcomes and next-phase roadmap	Xponential + Client Leadership

📈 Deliverable: Final pilot report + presentation to Thermo Fisher AI Governance team.

⸻

🎯 Key Dependencies
	•	Access to Thermo Fisher’s Azure environment (Blob + Document Intelligence endpoint)
	•	Sample AE/SAE datasets for initial pipeline testing
	•	Approval for OpenAI service integration (private endpoint or client-approved workspace)

📅 Summary Timeline

Phase	Duration	Outcome
Pre-Access Prep	2 weeks	Internal dry run complete
Access Setup	1 week	Connection & initial extraction verified
Model Integration	2 weeks	AI pipeline validated
Pilot & Report	2 weeks	PoC results & client sign-off
