Excellent clarification 👏 — since this proposal is specific to adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) for Thermo Fisher, the email and speaker notes should reflect that precision and regulatory tone.

Here’s your updated and polished version:

Subject: AI-Powered Adverse Event (AE/SAE) Data Modernization Proposal – Thermo Fisher

Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

Attached is the AI-Powered Adverse Event (AE/SAE) Data Modernization Proposal, focused on automating the extraction, normalization, and validation of AE and SAE case data from clinical safety reports.

This solution leverages Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Document Intelligence to streamline regulatory case processing and improve accuracy across pharmacovigilance workflows.

The proposal outlines:
	•	A two-model AI pipeline (Extractor + Normalizer) tailored for AE/SAE document processing.
	•	A Central Schema Service to enforce CDISC/FDA-compliant data structures and validation rules.
	•	A fully Azure-native architecture ensuring security, scalability, and compliance (HIPAA/GxP/21 CFR Part 11).
	•	A phased implementation roadmap and measurable business impact (speed, quality, cost).

The approach is designed to reduce manual review cycles, enhance data consistency, and accelerate downstream reporting to regulatory systems (e.g., Argus, MedDRA, E2B XML).

Please review the attached presentation at your convenience. I’d be happy to schedule a short walkthrough to discuss alignment with Thermo Fisher’s AE/SAE processing framework and next steps for a proof of concept.

🗒️ Speaker Notes / High-Level Talking Points

1. Objective
	•	Automate the extraction and standardization of Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) data from clinical and safety documents.
	•	Align with regulatory reporting standards (CDISC, ICH E2B, MedDRA).

2. Solution Approach
	•	Model A – Azure AI Document Intelligence
	•	Extracts case details: patient identifiers, event description, onset date, outcome, drug relationship, reporter details, etc.
	•	Model B – Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)
	•	Normalizes extracted fields to the standardized AE schema.
	•	Maps synonyms and validates controlled terminology (e.g., MedDRA preferred terms).
	•	Central Schema Service
	•	Governs schema versions, performs JSON validation, enforces confidence thresholds, and ensures compliance with regulatory data models.

3. Architecture Highlights
	•	Azure services: Blob, Durable Functions, Cosmos DB, SQL, API Management, OpenAI, Document Intelligence, Event Grid, Entra ID, and Key Vault.
	•	Event-driven and serverless — integrates easily with existing pharmacovigilance systems (e.g., Oracle Argus).

4. Business & Compliance Benefits
	•	Speed: AE/SAE case processing reduced from days to hours.
	•	Accuracy: >90% data precision across key regulatory fields.
	•	Compliance: GxP, HIPAA, 21 CFR Part 11 alignment.
	•	Auditability: Full lineage from document ingestion to final validated record.

5. Next Steps
	•	Begin with Discovery Phase (2 weeks) — sample dataset and schema definition.
	•	Build MVP for Adverse Event reports.
	•	Scale to full SAE dataset post-validation.
