Excellent question, Sajid 👏 — understanding Model A precisely is key when you’re pitching or building the Thermo Fisher AE/SAE automation solution.

Here’s a complete breakdown contextualized to your proposal.

⸻

🧠 Model A – The Extractor

Purpose

Model A is your deterministic extractor.
It’s responsible for reading the unstructured source (usually AE/SAE reports in PDF, Word, or scanned image form) and producing a structured JSON output that lists all the key-value pairs, tables, and text spans the document contains.

Think of it as the eyes of the system — it doesn’t interpret or normalize; it just captures every detail with coordinates and confidence.

⚙️ How Model A Works

Step	Component	What it Does
1️⃣ Input	AE/SAE document (PDF, scanned form, faxed report)	Uploaded to Azure Blob via Function trigger
2️⃣ Model	Azure AI Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer)	Runs the Read + Layout + (optional Custom)Key-Value Extraction models
3️⃣ Output	raw.json	Contains: text + bounding boxes + confidence + structure
4️⃣ Post-processing	Python / C# helper functions	• Remove noise (headers/footers)  • Merge multi-line fields  • Standardize dates/numbers  • Identify tables
5️⃣ Result	Cleaned “raw” JSON  → sent to Model B	Example below ↓

🧩 Why Model A is Critical

Benefit	Explanation
Speed & Cost	Azure Document Intelligence is cheaper/faster than running GPT-4 on full documents.
Structure Awareness	Captures spatial layout → useful for form fields and multi-column PDFs.
Explainability	Every field includes confidence and bbox for human review highlights.
Foundation for Model B	Model B (semantic normalizer) depends on this structured, confidence-scored JSON.


⸻

🔐 Azure Components Involved
	•	Azure Blob Storage → stores the uploaded document and raw JSON
	•	Azure AI Document Intelligence → performs layout and key-value extraction
	•	Azure Functions (Durable Orchestration) → invokes the model and manages output
	•	Azure Key Vault → secures API keys
	•	Azure Event Grid → publishes “ExtractionComplete” event to trigger Model B

📊 Key Configuration Choices

Option	Guidance
Model Type	Start with prebuilt Read + Layout; move to custom form model once you collect 50–100 AE/SAE samples.
Output Format	JSON (preferred) with coordinates → easily consumed by downstream LLM.
Confidence Threshold	Default ≥ 0.80 for critical fields; below → flag for human review.
Language Support	Multilingual possible (English + EU languages) if global safety reports.


⸻

🔄 Relationship to Model B

Stage	Model A	Model B
Focus	Extraction – raw text, layout, and fields	Normalization – semantic mapping to schema
Engine	Azure Document Intelligence	Azure OpenAI (GPT-4 / 4o)
Output	raw.json + confidences + bbox	normalized.json (schema-conformant)
Validation	Syntax and completeness	Semantic and regulatory compliance
Error handling	Low confidence → route to human review	Schema violation → re-prompt or review

🧪 Practical Tip for Your Pilot

Train a Custom Form Recognizer model using 50–100 historical AE/SAE case files with labeled fields such as Patient ID, Event Term, Onset Date, Outcome, Causality, Seriousness Criteria.
Once trained, its JSON output plugs directly into your Schema Service for validation.
 so you can clearly separate Model A = Extractor
