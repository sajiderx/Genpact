Hi Sajid,

 

Do you have any time on Monday after 2:30pm EDT to meet with me and Neil to see what’s going on with the resources that were sent onboarding emails?

 

Neil talked with Ahmet and there’s a problem that we need to get addressed. If Genpact is working on other TFS projects, there should be some knowledge there to help Ahmet.

 

Thanks,

Jim

Hi Jim,

It works for me. Thanks for confirming the Oct 29 session for SOW management. We have a two-week window before that meeting, I’d like to make productive use of this time to ensure we’re fully ready when access is granted.

Our plan is to:
- Request/Gain access to Azure Non-prod environment to simulate the Document Intelligence workflow.
- Finalize the Central Schema Service structure and validation logic.
- Prepare synthetic AE/SAE samples to test Model A extraction and Model B normalization.
- Document access dependencies for Blob storage, Form Recognizer endpoint, credentials for a smooth hand-off once Thermo Fisher provides the environment.

This will allow us to hit the ground running as soon as access is approved. Please let me know if there’s any early environment or schema documentation we can review during this period.

 

Regards

SI
