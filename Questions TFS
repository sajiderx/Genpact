Q1: What is “infinite layout handling via embedding-based clustering and ADAH”?


It means the framework can handle *any number of new form layouts* without manually training a model for each one.

* We use embedding-based clustering — turning layouts into numeric “fingerprints” and grouping similar ones together automatically.
* ADAH (Adaptive Data Annotation Heuristics) helps by learning from corrections made in HITL and applying those rules to future similar layouts.
  Value: It scales intelligently — no more retraining for every layout variation.

Okay, imagine you’re sorting different types of forms — some have boxes here, some there.
Instead of a person teaching the computer what each one looks like,
we give the computer a way to “see” all forms as shapes and patterns (that’s the embedding).

It then groups similar forms together automatically (that’s the clustering part).
And when a person fixes something once, the system remembers the fix and applies it to future similar forms (that’s the ADAH part — it learns from experience).

👉 In short: The system teaches itself to handle new layouts without needing a person to program every one.


Q2: Didn’t we already discuss this — confidence scoring, arbitration, schema validation, semantic checks?


Yes — this is the *refined version* of what we discussed.
Earlier, confidence scoring was mostly about extractor accuracy.
Now, we’ve expanded it into a unified arbitration layer that also decides which model’s output (Textract, DI, or AOAI) to trust per field, using weighted historical accuracy.
Likewise, schema validation now includes semantic checks — ensuring fields like drug names, event severity, or dates are valid per external standards (e.g., RxNorm, MedDRA).
Value: This closes the loop between model output and regulatory data integrity.

Before, we had the models (Textract, DI, AOAI) each trying to guess answers — like three kids shouting answers to a quiz.
Now, we’ve added a referee (the arbitration layer) who listens to all three and picks the most reliable one based on who’s been right most often.
That’s what confidence scoring does.

Then, schema validation checks the final answer — like a teacher marking homework — to make sure things make sense (dates look like dates, drug names are real, severity isn’t missing).

👉 In short: We made the system smarter — it now double-checks and picks the best answer automatically.

Q3: What do you mean by “Framework foundation: Layout registry + Confidence scoring + HITL loop for adaptive scaling”?


That’s our *three-pillar foundation* for continuous improvement:

1. Layout Registry → remembers every layout and correction for reuse.
2. Confidence Scoring → dynamically chooses the best extractor output per case.
3. HITL Loop → human feedback flows back into registry and models.
   Value: Together, they enable adaptive scaling — the system gets smarter with every document processed, reducing manual review over time.

Think of this as a memory, brain, and feedback system:

Layout Registry (Memory): Keeps track of every form we’ve seen and how we handled it.

Confidence Scoring (Brain): Decides who gave the best answer.

HITL Loop (Feedback): If a person fixes something, the system remembers that correction forever.

👉 In short: The system learns from every mistake and keeps getting better over time — like a student that never forgets a lesson.
