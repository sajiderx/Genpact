You're a large scale Angular application. How do you organize modules, components, services and routing?

So basically it's not that I have too much experience regarding the Angular, but based on my TypeScript experience, which I'm working on Nets JS and Node JS, we start by first dividing the application into modules. I usually tend to decide.
Dinion Svirca 0 minutes 32 seconds
Decide on modules based on the type of work that they do. For example, when I've worked on a payment service, I could divide the application into refunds modules. I can go on and for example one time payments.
Dinion Svirca 0 minutes 51 seconds
I then can add another module regarding subscription and so on. Based on the routing part, I decide based on the module name, but first I have a main routing point which is usually the one that targets up.

And then based on the modules I go and fix all the routing parts. So that's what I would do based on my TypeScript experience.

OK.
Sajid Inayat 1 minute 25 seconds
OK, let's switch gear to react. Explain use state, use effect, use contacts and use reducer. When would you use each?

Dinion Svirca 1 minute 38 seconds
Actually I don't have any experience with React, so I don't know what to say regarding this one.

Sajid Inayat

Sajid Inayat 1 minute 42 seconds
OK, OK, OK, no problem. Anything on web socket integration?
DS

Dinion Svirca

Dinion Svirca 1 minute 51 seconds
Yeah, I've in my experience, I mentioned earlier that I worked in a chat support system. We had to use Websockets in order to keep the communication alive between the client and the support that were working in our company. I used Signalr, which is a framework of.net that helps.

Dinion Svirca 9 minutes 17 seconds
Mhm.
Dinion Svirca 9 minutes 28 seconds
I'm not sure on this part because I I use that with the support of AI, so I cannot give you a proper answer on this one.

Sajid Inayat
9 minutes 35 seconds9:35
Sajid Inayat 9 minutes 35 seconds
OK, OK.
Sajid Inayat 9 minutes 38 seconds
No, no problem. So anything on real time updates from interface using web sockets, signal R, polling or something else? Do you have any insight into that?
DS
Dinion Svirca
9 minutes 53 seconds9:53
Dinion Svirca 9 minutes 53 seconds
Yes, one proper example that I have based on my experience is updating for example chat status using that sockets once a new connection was made from the support.
Dinion Svirca 10 minutes 11 seconds
From the support site, for example, they logged in on their browser. We notified the client by changing the chat support status to available. What's more, we use Signalar on showing messages that the client or the support staff.

10 minutes 24 seconds
Cool.

Dinion Svirca
10 minutes 31 seconds10:31
Dinion Svirca 10 minutes 31 seconds
Sent to each other. We did that by establishing a connection on sign lor which then opened the web socket and then we sent the messages through the web sockets that were available. I also implemented the priority based algorithm which was used.
Dinion Svirca 10 minutes 50 seconds
For example, we had different staff, support staff which was which were of different seniority, so we had to assign more complex chats to more senior staff.
Dinion Svirca 11 minutes 8 seconds
And we did that by first gathering some information on the client side, then we put them into some kind of queues and we would inform staff based on the queues that they had, they had.

Sajid Inayat 11 minutes 24 seconds
OK. OK. All right. So do you have any question for me, Daniel?
DS
Dinion Svirca
11 minutes 30 seconds11:30
Dinion Svirca 11 minutes 30 seconds
I think you mentioned that you're going to work with Azure and Databricks, right?

Sajid Inayat
11 minutes 36 seconds11:36
Sajid Inayat 11 minutes 36 seconds
Yes, but that would be different team members. You might have you know some visibility into it and you might end up working with those guys. But what we are looking for is a front end heavy. So 70% of your work would be on front end and maybe 30% on the back end. So it won't.
DS
Dinion Svirca
11 minutes 38 seconds11:38
Dinion Svirca 11 minutes 38 seconds
Or.
Dinion Svirca 11 minutes 54 seconds
Mm.

Sajid Inayat
11 minutes 56 seconds11:56
Sajid Inayat 11 minutes 56 seconds
Be like you are working on algorithms and things. It'll be front end work, yeah.
DS
Dinion Svirca
12 minutes 1 second12:01
Dinion Svirca 12 minutes 1 second
Oh, so OK, now I got it. I think that it was vice versa, but OK, so the if the new hire comes, he will be working, he or she will be working with building a new platform for the existing one, like rewriting the entire.
Dinion Svirca 12 minutes 21 seconds
Flow. OK, what kind of databases do you use or you just?

Sajid Inayat
12 minutes 21 seconds12:21
Sajid Inayat 12 minutes 21 seconds
Yes, yes.
Sajid Inayat 12 minutes 28 seconds
It's mostly within Azure, but the front end would be Angular or React and most of that work would be through APIs and then there will be some other tech stack, so.
DS
Dinion Svirca
12 minutes 33 seconds12:33
Dinion Svirca 12 minutes 33 seconds
Hmm.
Dinion Svirca 12 minutes 36 seconds
Mhm.

Sajid Inayat
12 minutes 44 seconds12:44
Sajid Inayat 12 minutes 44 seconds
As long so when you talk to a client, right, the first thing they'll ask, hey, how's your front end? What code you have written? What technology stack you work with, right? If you say that you are a back end guy, that's a deal breaker. They'll say oh.
Sajid Inayat 13 minutes
We are looking for front end, right? So even though there is some component for the back end like 30% but mostly it's front end, then it becomes difficult to justify with the client that OK, you know why do we have a back end expert working on front end?
Sajid Inayat 13 minutes 18 seconds
Deal, right. It becomes difficult to sustain unless you think you can handle it and you're willing to do that because you have to, even if you have a good understanding, you have to have a will to actually deliver on that, right? So.
DS
Dinion Svirca
13 minutes 19 seconds13:19
Dinion Svirca 13 minutes 19 seconds
Yeah.
Dinion Svirca 13 minutes 36 seconds
Yeah, are you? I totally get what you're saying.

Sajid Inayat
13 minutes 38 seconds13:38
Sajid Inayat 13 minutes 38 seconds
So you tell me, would you be able to sustain and perform a 7030 ratio of front end versus back end? Is this something you want to do right?
DS
Dinion Svirca
13 minutes 51 seconds13:51
Dinion Svirca 13 minutes 51 seconds
I actually will have to think about that because I will have to to 1st learn either Angular at a higher level level or start on a React from scratch. So having the responsibility of being a tech lead with my current knowledge and front end, I think that.
Dinion Svirca 14 minutes 11 seconds
I will have to work quite hard in order to achieve the level of performing that you're asking. So probably I will have to think about that, but I'm more of a back end guy, so that may be the deal breaker like you said.

Sajid Inayat
14 minutes 25 seconds14:25
Sajid Inayat 14 minutes 25 seconds
OK.
Sajid Inayat 14 minutes 28 seconds
OK. OK. I appreciate that. I know you're out of time, but it was nice talking to you. If I have any back end position come up and it will eventually, right, maybe new feature then I can always.
Sajid Inayat 14 minutes 44 seconds
Ask Andre to reach out to you.
DS
Dinion Svirca
14 minutes 46 seconds14:46
Dinion Svirca 14 minutes 46 seconds
Sure, I would be. I would be honored to be conducted again and probably work with you guys.

Sajid Inayat
14 minutes 47 seconds14:47
Sajid Inayat 14 minutes 47 seconds
He will get back to you.
Sajid Inayat 14 minutes 52 seconds
Alright, cool. Thank you. Thanks.
Sajid Inayat 14 minutes 56 seconds
Take care. Bye.
