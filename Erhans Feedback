2. Strengths in technical/functional skills, communication, or anything impressive.

Dinion was extremely honest and professional throughout the interview, which I really appreciated. He didn't try to BS his way through questions he didn't know - when I asked about React, he straight up said "I don't have experience with that" rather than trying to fake it. That kind of integrity is rare.

On the backend side, he's clearly solid. He has good experience with .NET, Node.js, and TypeScript, and when he talked about the chat support system he built with priority-based routing for different staff levels, you could tell he thinks about business logic and real-world problems. His approach to organizing code by domain/feature (payments, refunds, subscriptions) shows he understands modular architecture conceptually.

Communication-wise, he was clear and articulate. No rambling, no defensiveness. When it became obvious this wasn't the right fit, he handled it maturely and didn't waste anyone's time. He'd be a pleasure to work with on the right project.



3. Gaps in skills, fit, or anything we should keep in mind.

Here's the issue - this is a fundamental mismatch. We need a frontend-heavy Tech Lead (70% frontend, 30% backend), and Dinion is a backend developer who describes himself as "more of a back end guy."

His frontend experience is pretty limited:
- Angular: He admitted upfront "I don't have too much experience with Angular." His answers were surface-level - he could talk about organizing modules by feature, but didn't mention anything about lazy loading, shared modules, RxJS, change detection, or any of the deeper Angular concepts a Tech Lead would need to know.

- React: Zero experience. Just flat out said he's never used it.

- Tech Lead readiness: He'd need to "learn Angular at a higher level or start React from scratch" (his words). A Tech Lead needs to be an expert who can mentor others, not someone learning the tech stack.

There was also a concerning moment where he talked about implementing WebSocket features "with the support of AI" and then admitted "I cannot give you a proper answer on this one." For a Tech Lead role, we need someone who deeply understands what they're building, not someone copying AI-generated code without full comprehension.

Bottom line: He's a mid-level backend developer being considered for a senior frontend leadership role. Wrong specialization entirely.



4. Would this candidate align well with our team and work environment?

If we had a backend-focused role, absolutely yes. Dinion seems like he'd be a great team player - honest, professional, good communicator, and he has that self-awareness to know when something isn't the right fit.

But for this specific role? No. The client expects a frontend expert from day one. We can't justify putting a backend developer who needs to learn the tech stack into a Tech Lead position. It would set him up to fail and disappoint the client. Even if he worked really hard to ramp up (which he acknowledged he'd need to do), we're talking 6-12 months before he'd be productive at the level required. That's not fair to anyone.

His attitude and work ethic seem solid, but the skills gap is just too wide for this particular opportunity.



5. Anything the next interviewer should explore deeper in the next round?

There shouldn't be a next round for this position. This is a hard pass.

However, keep Dinion warm for backend opportunities. When we have .NET, Node.js, or backend-heavy full-stack roles (like 70% backend, 30% frontend), he'd be worth considering. At that point, we'd want to dig deeper into:

- His .NET architecture experience (CQRS, microservices, design patterns)
- API design and development
- Database optimization and query performance
- His experience leading backend projects or mentoring junior developers
- Real examples of complex backend problems he's solved (without AI assistance)

For now though, we need to go back to the drawing board and find someone with actual frontend depth for Thermo Fisher.





# EMAIL SUMMARY TO RECRUITER



Subject: Dinion Svirca Interview Feedback - Not Recommended for Frontend Tech Lead

Hi [Recruiter Name],

Just wrapped up the interview with Dinion Svirca for the Thermo Fisher Frontend Tech Lead position. Unfortunately, this isn't the right fit.

Quick Summary:

Overall Rating: Fail (for this specific role)

The Core Issue:  
Dinion is a backend developer applying for a frontend-heavy (70%) Tech Lead role. It's a fundamental specialization mismatch.

What We Found:
- Limited Angular experience - he admitted upfront "I don't have too much experience with Angular" and his answers were pretty surface-level
- Zero React experience - when I asked about React hooks, he said he's never used React
- Not Tech Lead ready for frontend - he acknowledged he'd need to "learn Angular at a higher level or start React from scratch"
- AI dependency concern - mentioned using AI to implement WebSocket features and couldn't explain it independently

The Good News:
Dinion was incredibly honest and professional. He didn't try to oversell himself, and when it became clear this wasn't the right match, he handled it maturely. He's got solid backend experience (.NET, Node.js, TypeScript) and would absolutely be worth considering for backend-focused roles when they come up.

His Own Words:  
"I'm more of a back end guy, so that may be the deal breaker like you said."

He self-selected out, which honestly saved us all time.

Bottom Line:  
We're trying to fit a square peg in a round hole here. The client needs a frontend expert who can lead from day one. Dinion would need 6+ months just to get up to speed on the tech stack before he could even think about leading others. That's not viable.

Next Steps:
- Do not move forward for Thermo Fisher Frontend Tech Lead
- Keep in pipeline for backend .NET or Node.js roles
- Tag his profile as "Backend Developer - Mid/Senior Level"

Process Improvement:  
Can we add a pre-screen question about frontend vs backend specialization percentage? Would help avoid these mismatches before we get to technical interviews. Maybe require GitHub/portfolio links upfront for frontend roles?

Let me know when backend positions open up - Dinion would be a solid candidate for those.

Thanks,  
Sajid



P.S. - I'm working on a better pre-screening checklist and frontend question bank so we can catch these mismatches earlier. Will share with the team soon.



Perfect ‚Äî your draft already nails the structure and tone. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd **refine and shorten it** for two formats ‚Äî one for **Teams/Slack** (human, concise, conversational) and one for **email** (slightly formal but still natural).

## üí¨ **Teams/Slack Version (Conversational & Tight)**

**Subject/Intro:** Quick correction on the Thermo Fisher frontend role

Hey team,

Looks like we‚Äôve been sourcing the wrong ‚Äúfrontend‚Äù profile ‚Äî the client needs **.NET frontend developers**, not Angular or React specialists.

**What that means:**
We‚Äôre looking for devs who build UIs **using C# and .NET**, not JavaScript frameworks.

**What to look for:**

* **Must-have:** Blazor, ASP.NET MVC (with Razor), SignalR
* **Nice-to-have:** Angular/React (bonus only), Azure, CI/CD
* **Primary language:** C#
* **50%+ of work:** true UI development, not backend APIs

**Search terms:** ‚ÄúBlazor developer‚Äù, ‚Äú.NET full stack (frontend focus)‚Äù, ‚ÄúASP.NET MVC developer‚Äù
**Avoid:** pure Angular/React or backend-only profiles

**Quick screen question:**
*‚ÄúHave you built user interfaces using Blazor or ASP.NET MVC?‚Äù*
‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí good fit
‚ùå No ‚Üí pass

We missed this nuance with Migen and Dinion ‚Äî let‚Äôs correct that going forward.
Ping me if you‚Äôd like to review profiles together.

## üìß **Email Version (Professional but Natural)**

**Subject:** Updated Sourcing Criteria ‚Äì Thermo Fisher Frontend Developer

Hi Andre,

Following Neil‚Äôs feedback, we‚Äôve refined the profile to ensure we target the right type of frontend developer. The client is specifically looking for a **.NET frontend developer**, not a JavaScript-focused one.

**Here‚Äôs the updated criteria for sourcing:**

**Core Skills:**

* Strong in **C# and .NET (Core/Framework)**
* Experience with **ASP.NET MVC (Razor)** or **Blazor** for UI development
* Familiarity with **SignalR** for real-time features
* Comfortable integrating frontend components with .NET backends

**Bonus Skills:**

* Angular/React (helpful but not required)
* Cloud experience (Azure/AWS)
* CI/CD pipeline knowledge

**Search terms to use:**
‚ÄúBlazor developer,‚Äù ‚Äú.NET full stack (frontend),‚Äù ‚ÄúASP.NET MVC developer‚Äù

**Pre-screen question:**
*‚ÄúHave you built user interfaces using Blazor or ASP.NET MVC?‚Äù*
If yes, proceed; if not, likely the wrong profile.

Our last few candidates leaned more toward data analysis or backend work, so this should help narrow the focus.
Let me know if you‚Äôd like to review or refine this further together.

Best,
**Sajid**

Would you like me to make a **third, pinned quick-reference version** (like a short table you can post in Teams for recruiters to keep handy)?
