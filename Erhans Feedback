**Subject:** Erhan Interview Debrief - Not Recommended

Hi Frank (cc: Chris),

Just finished the screening call with Erhan Krasniqi. Unfortunately, I don't think he's the right fit for the Thermo Fisher project. Let me walk you through what happened.

**The Short Version:**

Erhan has decent backend .NET experience, but his frontend skills are way weaker than his CV suggests. When I asked him about Angular (which he lists as "Angular 19+" on his resume), he couldn't explain basic concepts like lazy loading. When I asked about JavaScript fundamentals - literally var/let/const, entry-level stuff - he couldn't answer. And when I asked how he'd architect a complex form, his response was basically "if API is ready, I call it."

Halfway through, when I asked about microservices frontend architecture, he just said **"I'm not a frontend guy."**

That's a problem because we need someone who can build the entire review interface for Thermo Fisher - the document viewer, the editable forms, the validation, all of it. He can't do that.

**The Backend Side:**

On the .NET/backend stuff, he's okay but not great. He could probably handle building microservices and working with Azure, but even there, his answers were pretty surface-level. No depth, no real examples, just vague statements like "MVC is old, Core is better."

**Resume vs Reality:**

His CV says he's working with Angular 19+, React, Next.js - all this modern frontend stuff. But in the interview, he admitted he's "not good with Angular," forgot basic definitions, and never even heard of Tailwind CSS (which is everywhere now). There's a big disconnect between what's on paper and what he can actually do.

**Why This Matters for Thermo Fisher:**

We're building a full platform - backend services AND a complete frontend for document review. If we hire Erhan, we get maybe 50% of what we need, then we'd have to hire another person just for frontend. That doubles our cost and creates coordination headaches.

Plus, he'd be on calls with Thermo Fisher's technical team. His communication wasn't terrible, but it wasn't sharp either. Thick accent, vague responses, couldn't articulate decisions clearly. I don't think he'd represent us well in those client discussions.

**My Recommendation:**

Pass on Erhan. Keep looking for someone who's genuinely full-stack - strong backend AND can actually build a modern UI. 

I'm attaching the formal interview feedback form for your records.

**What We Should Do Differently:**

Going forward, I think we need to add a quick technical assessment before the interview - maybe a simple coding challenge or ask for GitHub repos. That would've caught this earlier and saved everyone time.

Let me know if you want to discuss, but I'm pretty clear this isn't the right fit.

Thanks,
Sajid

**Subject:** Erhan Interview - Not the One

Hey Frank,

Just wrapped up with Erhan. Not gonna work out for Thermo Fisher.

**Quick Summary:**

Guy's CV says he's a full-stack engineer with Angular and React experience. Reality? He's a backend developer who can't do frontend. Like, couldn't explain basic JavaScript (var vs let vs const), couldn't describe how lazy loading works in Angular, and when I asked about building a complex UI, he basically said "I just call the API."

Then he straight up told me **"I'm not a frontend guy."** Well, we need a frontend guy. Or at least someone who can do both.

Backend skills are okay - he knows .NET and REST APIs - but nothing special. Definitely not the senior/lead level we need. And his communication was pretty rough - vague answers, couldn't give real examples, thick accent made it harder.

**The Problem:**

His resume is inflated. Says "Angular 19+" as current work, but couldn't answer basic Angular questions. Says he migrated a system to "ReactJS + Next.js" but couldn't explain React hooks correctly. Either he's lying or he was barely involved in those frontend pieces.

For Thermo Fisher, we need someone building microservices AND the review UI. He can maybe do half of that. If we hire him, we'd need to hire someone else for frontend, which defeats the purpose.

**Recommendation:** Hard pass. Keep looking.

Feedback form attached for the files.

Let me know if you want to chat about it, but I'm pretty confident on this one.

## **CONVERSATIONAL FEEDBACK FORM**

Here's a more conversational version of the assessment form:

---

**CANDIDATE SCREENING FEEDBACK**

**Candidate:** Erhan Krasniqi  
**Position:** Senior .NET Engineer / Technical Lead  
**Interviewer:** Sajid Inayat  
**Date:** [Date]  
**Interview Duration:** ~60 minutes

---

### **OVERALL RECOMMENDATION**

‚òê Strong Hire  
‚òê Hire  
‚òê Maybe / Need More Info  
‚òë **Pass**

---

### **TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT**

**Backend .NET Skills:** 6/10
- Knows the basics of .NET Core, MVC, REST APIs, JWT
- But answers were really surface-level
- Couldn't articulate why you'd choose one approach over another
- No real depth when explaining architecture decisions
- Example: When asked about .NET Core vs MVC, just said "MVC is old, Core is better" - not helpful

**Frontend Skills:** 2/10 ‚ùå **Major Problem**
- CV says Angular 19+, React, Next.js experience
- Reality: Couldn't answer basic questions
- Failed to explain lazy loading (said it was "extraction of data out of table" - completely wrong)
- Couldn't explain var/let/const in JavaScript (this is day-one stuff)
- Said React hooks are "used for memory" (wrong - they're for state/lifecycle)
- When asked about microservices frontend: **"I'm not a frontend guy"**
- Never heard of Tailwind CSS

**Communication:** 5/10
- Understandable but thick accent
- Vague, short answers
- Couldn't provide detailed examples
- Struggled to explain technical concepts clearly

---

### **KEY STRENGTHS**

1. Has actual .NET backend experience (not entry-level)
2. Worked on large projects (ERPs, government portals)
3. Knows REST APIs and basic authentication
4. Created a NuGet package (shows some initiative): https://www.nuget.org/packages/CQRSDecorate.Net

---

### **KEY CONCERNS**

1. **Resume Inflation** - Big gap between CV and actual skills
   - CV: "Angular 19+" as current work
   - Reality: "Not good with Angular" and couldn't explain basics

2. **Cannot Do Frontend** - Critical for our project
   - Admitted "not a frontend guy"
   - Can't build the UI we need for Thermo Fisher
   - Would need to hire separate frontend developer

3. **Lack of Technical Depth** - Even on backend
   - Vague explanations
   - No real examples or reasoning
   - Couldn't walk through architectural decisions

4. **Communication Gaps** - Risky for client-facing role
   - Would struggle in technical discussions with Thermo Fisher
   - Can't articulate solutions clearly
   - Doesn't inspire confidence

---

### **SPECIFIC INTERVIEW MOMENTS**

**Good Moment:**
- He shared a NuGet package he built for CQRS, which shows he's been thinking about patterns

**Bad Moments:**
- Asked about var/let/const: No response, couldn't answer
- Asked about lazy loading: "Extraction of data out of table" (completely wrong definition)
- Asked about complex form: "If API is ready then I call" (no actual architecture thinking)
- Asked about frontend architecture: "Not a frontend guy" (disqualifying statement)

---

### **FIT FOR THERMO FISHER PROJECT**

**What We Need:**
- ‚ùå Full-stack engineer (frontend + backend)
- ‚ùå Build complex review interface with forms, validation, real-time updates
- ‚ùå Technical leadership and client-facing discussions
- ‚ùå Mentor other developers

**What We'd Get:**
- Marginal backend developer
- Zero frontend capability
- Questionable communication for client calls
- Not a leader - can't explain decisions or mentor

**Gap:** About 50-60% of what we actually need

---

### **BOTTOM LINE**

Erhan is a backend-focused .NET developer who has significantly inflated his frontend experience on his CV. He cannot deliver the frontend components we need for Thermo Fisher, and even his backend skills are just "okay" - not the senior/lead level we're looking for.

If we hire him, we'd need to:
1. Hire another person for frontend (doubles cost)
2. Accept weaker technical leadership than we need
3. Risk poor impression with client

**Not worth it. Keep looking.**

---

### **LESSONS LEARNED**

For future candidates:
1. Ask basic technical questions early (catches resume inflation)
2. Require code samples or GitHub repos upfront
3. When someone says "I'm not a [X] guy" for a required skill, believe them
4. Don't assume CV accuracy - verify everything

---

### **NEXT STEPS**

- Continue candidate search
- Focus on verified full-stack experience
- Consider adding technical assessment before interview

## **WHICH APPROACH?**

**My Recommendation:**

Send the **slightly more casual email** (the second one) with the **conversational feedback form** attached.

**Why:**
- Frank knows you, so you can be more direct
- Email gives him the "so what" quickly
- Form provides documentation for HR/records
- Conversational tone matches how you'd actually talk to him

**Don't overthink it.** Frank just needs to know:
1. Is this person good? **No.**
2. Why not? **Can't do frontend, resume inflated.**
3. What should we do? **Keep looking.**

The email gives him that in 30 seconds. The form gives him details if he wants them.
